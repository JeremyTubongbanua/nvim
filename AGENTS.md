# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
Configuration entrypoint lives in `init.lua`, which bootstraps Lazy.nvim and loads modules from the `lua/` tree. Runtime settings, keymaps, and autocmds sit under `lua/config/`, while plugin specs are grouped in `lua/plugins/` (one file per feature such as `lsp.lua`, `telescope.lua`). Persistent session data is kept in `shada/`, and plugin pins are tracked in `lazy-lock.json` so collaborators install matching versions.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Use Neovim itself to manage the environment. Run `nvim --headless "+Lazy sync" +qa` after pulling changes to install or update plugins per the lockfile. `nvim --headless "+Lazy check" +qa` validates that pinned plugins are available. Launch `nvim` normally to verify interactive behaviour once headless checks pass.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Lua modules should remain scoped under `lua/` with snake_case filenames, mirroring their require paths (`require("config.options")`). Inside files, prefer two-space indentation, trailing commas in plugin spec tables, and local helper functions near their usage. Avoid global stateâ€”export values via return tables when needed. Keep comments short and focused on non-obvious behaviour; configuration keys themselves act as documentation.

## Testing Guidelines
Smoke-test changes by running `nvim --headless "+checkhealth" +qa` to surface missing dependencies. For plugin updates, open Neovim and run `:Lazy log` to ensure migrations succeed, then exercise targeted features (e.g., run `:Telescope find_files` when editing `telescope.lua`). Update `lazy-lock.json` only after verifying the new plugin versions behave as expected.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
This directory is typically synced into your dotfiles repo; if using Git, follow short imperative commit titles that explain the behaviour change (e.g., "telescope: add live grep keymap"). Group related edits by module, and mention affected plugins in the body. Pull requests should describe the motivation, list manual test steps (`nvim --headless "+Lazy sync" +qa`), and attach screenshots or logs when UI-facing plugins are involved.

## Plugin Management Tips
Run `:Lazy restore` if you need to revert to lockfile versions after experimentation. Remove unused plugin files from `lua/plugins/` rather than disabling entries, keeping the spec clean. When adding new tools, document prerequisites (e.g., external binaries) inside the plugin file so contributors can install them ahead of time.
